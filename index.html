    <p> In this world to survive you need a positive view about things and life. You
    <p>daily need some inspiration. Life is a beautiful gift given to us by God. But some bad things</p>
    <p> happen to us in this daily routine life. And we lose a positive outlook on life. We lose our</p>
    <p> happiness and concentration towards our work and relationships.</p>

      <li>In the next week or maybe even the next year but this is okay.</li>
      <li>We tend to focus on the end goals rather than the small and significant steps we take to get us to that goal.</li>
      <li>This is why it’s important to acknowledge and celebrate small wins.</li>
      <li> The problem with not doing this is we end up diminishing our motivation and motivation is what keeps us on the right path and gives us the strength to soldier on to the top of the mountain.</li>
      <li>Demotivation usually comes because we are unsure of how far we are to our goals.</li>
      <li>We sometimes blindly believe that the goal is still so far away when it could actually be just around the corner.</li>
      <li>Something we will never know if we give up.</li>
      <li>Acknowledging these sparks the reward circuitry of our brains and releases chemicals that gives us the feeling of pride.</li>
      <li>Giving us the feel-good and happiness factor and makes us want to go further towards our next achievement.</li>
